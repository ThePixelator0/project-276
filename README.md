# Project Proposal
Project Name: EatTrainBalance(ETB)
06/18/2023

Abstract:
EatTrainBalance will be an all in one health web application that will allow users to reach their health goals by being able to track their workouts, meals, and nutrition. ETB will have five definite features in order for the app to be complete. People who use the application will be able to create their own accounts, track nutrition and workouts, create recipes and meal plans. The system will use various api’s to be able to get data for different foods and workouts, the two main api’s that will be used are CalorieKing’s food api and Exercises api from api ninja. This application is intended to be a comprehensive suite of tools for health management and physical self improvement, any user should be able to rely on this app and the data it provides to properly manage and reach their health goals.

Customer Description:
The target audience for ETB would typically include individuals who are interested in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and closely monitoring their nutrition. This can include individuals with specific dietary goals, such as weight loss or muscle gain. The target audience may also include fitness enthusiasts, athletes, or individuals who want to improve their overall well-being through proper nutrition. Additionally, people who are actively seeking to track their calorie intake, set up meal and workout plans would also be part of ETB’s target audience.

Competitive landscape: 
MyFitnessPal is another health application that also helps users track workouts and food nutrition facts, and is possibly the most popular health tracking application in the world. ETB will have many features that will be similar to MyFitnessPal however there will be an emphasis on data aggregation. That is the ability to see the long term results of data from the different features the ETB offers like nutrition tracking, workout tracking. Meal plans and recipe features will be built to be able to integrate with nutrition tracking in order to make the app seamless and easy to use as well.

Epics:

Login/Register
User will be able to create an account on their first visit to the website and log into their account. The account will save all information from other parts of the site, such as from the nutritional data of food eaten and workout tracking. On the main page there will be a button for “Login” and another for “Sign Up”. The buttons will take the user to a separate page where they can create an account or log into an already created account. To sign up, a user will need to input an email address, their name, and a password for their account. To log in, the user will need to give an email address and password associated with their account. Both pages will take the user to their home page, logged into their account. As the user navigates and interacts with the application, the data will be saved under their account in the application’s database. 

Nutritional Data Tracking
User is someone who wants to track the nutrients that they intake every day through what they eat. The user also wants to be able to set goals for different nutrient intake. After the user eats a certain food they will access the “Home” dashboard which displays various tabs that can help the user track nutrition, health and exercise. The user clicks on a tab that says “track food nutrition”. This dashboard will display the current date and will allow the user to add a new food for that specific day. The system will then save this food and will have the nutritional data associated with this food like calories, protein, and fat also saved and displayed on the dashboard for that specific food. They do this with multiple foods for that day and throughout the week. By the end of the week they click on “Check this week’s nutrition data'' to see the aggregate of all the nutritional data from the foods that they ate throughout the week.

Workout Tracking
The user, characterised as a committed fitness enthusiast driven by the aspiration to enhance their physical and mental well-being, seeks a comprehensive solution to effectively track and monitor their workouts. It is imperative for the user to easily navigate to the workout tracking page within the fitness app, enabling them to diligently record the exercises performed and their respective durations on a daily basis. By leveraging this feature, the user can meticulously monitor their workout progress, ensuring they remain accountable to their exercise routine. Moreover, the user can actively establish personal records, further fueling their motivation and dedication to their fitness goals. The inclusion of a comprehensive progress visualisation mechanism allows the user to evaluate the frequency and duration of their workouts across different time frames, including weekly, monthly, and yearly intervals. This affords the user a holistic overview of their activity levels, facilitating a more accurate assessment of their commitment to completing workouts. Ultimately, the workout tracking feature serves as an indispensable tool for the user, supporting their relentless pursuit of fitness excellence while providing a clear and visual representation of their workout history.

Recipes
As a User, I'd like to explore and use the Recipes area to construct meals depending on my preferences and the ingredients I have on hand.
Criteria for Acceptance:

1. As a User, I should be able to simply get to the Recipes section from the main dashboard or menu when I log in.

2. As a User, I'd like to look for recipes that use things I already have on hand. After I enter my available ingredients into the search window, I should be provided with a list of suggested recipes using those items.

3. As a User, I would like to be able to filter search results by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), preparation time, difficulty level, dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.).

4. When I choose a recipe from the search results, I should be taken to a comprehensive recipe page. The recipe title, a high-quality photograph, a list of required ingredients, thorough cooking directions, prep time, cooking time, and serving size should all be included on this page. If the recipe calls for items I don't have, the system should notify me.

5. I'd like to see the nutritional analysis of each recipe as a User. I could get provided with a full nutritional chart for each recipe, containing details such as calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates, fibre, and sugar per serving.

6. As a User, I should be able to bookmark my favourite recipes for later access. Within the Recipes area, the saved recipes should be accessible via a 'Favourites' tab.

7. I want to be able to rate and review the recipes I've tested as a User. When other users look into the recipe, they should be able to see these ratings and reviews.

8. As a User, I should be able to share recipes on the social board and other social media platforms in order to propose good recipes to my friends and family.

Meal Plans
User is someone interested in maintaining a healthy diet and seeks to plan meals to balance nutritional intake. The user will access the “meal plan” page and be able to create and manage meal plans. Creating a meal plan allows user to choose between ETB’s vast set of food options or user created meals from the Recipes section. Upon creating a meal plan, the user will be able to see the nutritional information per meal (calories, protein, etc.). The user will then be able to set the duration of the meal plan (daily, weekly).
